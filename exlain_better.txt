Fam2p2 (Multi-object, Single target tracking, ultra fast)
target the top most object (the object that's first seen)
Proposed algorithm 1: 
# idea: (row by row)check pixel, if no 3 consecutive whites jump 10 pixels ahead
Skip 1 row by default, if 3 consecutive all black rows, start jumping 4 rows at a time 

# if 3 consecutive whites, then jump 5 and see if the next one is also white, 
# search to the right until reach a black pixel (cannot go to the left since that will cause array to be unsorted), won't attempt to finish the whole row (assuming that's the only object of interest) 
# (jumps 1 row by default again) start the search 20 pixels before the last "first recorded white pixel" (gives a lead of 20 pixel size increase each row)

# if the whole row is black after the object has already been detected, this means that the object no longer exists. Stop search and return median immediately)

Raw, 10 on each side:

O O [X X X X X X X X X X (X) X X X X X X X X X X]

Worst Case 1:
O O X X X X X X X X [X {X X X X} (X) {X X X X} X {X X}]

Worst Case 2:
[X X X X X]
